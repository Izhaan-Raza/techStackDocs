### **Day 1-5: Introduction and Basics**
#### **Day 1**
- Understand what Docker is and why it’s used.
- Learn about containers vs. virtual machines.
- Install Docker on your system:
  - [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for Windows/Mac.
  - Docker CLI for Linux.
- Verify installation with `docker --version` and `docker run hello-world`.

#### **Day 2**
- Learn about basic Docker terminology:
  - Images, Containers, Registries, Volumes.
- Understand the Docker architecture (Docker CLI, Docker Daemon, Docker Hub).

#### **Day 3**
- Run your first container:
  - `docker run ubuntu:latest`
- Use basic Docker commands:
  - `docker ps`, `docker stop`, `docker start`, `docker rm`.
- Inspect containers with:
  - `docker inspect`, `docker logs`, `docker exec`.

#### **Day 4**
- Learn about Docker Hub:
  - Search for images: `docker search <image_name>`.
  - Pull images: `docker pull <image_name>`.
  - Push an image to Docker Hub (requires account).

#### **Day 5**
- Explore container lifecycle:
  - Create (`docker create`), Start, Stop, Restart, Pause, Remove.

### **Day 6-10: Working with Images**
#### **Day 6**
- Understand Docker images:
  - Layers and how images are built.
- List images with `docker images`.

#### **Day 7**
- Learn how to build your own images:
  - Create a `Dockerfile` with basic instructions like `FROM`, `RUN`, and `CMD`.
  - Build an image: `docker build -t myapp .`.

#### **Day 8**
- Explore Dockerfile instructions:
  - `COPY`, `ADD`, `EXPOSE`, `ENV`, `WORKDIR`.

#### **Day 9**
- Optimize Dockerfiles:
  - Use multistage builds to reduce image size.
  - Best practices for writing Dockerfiles.

#### **Day 10**
- Tag and version images:
  - `docker tag myapp:latest myapp:v1.0`.
- Push your custom image to Docker Hub.

---

### **Day 11-15: Docker Volumes and Networking**
#### **Day 11**
- Understand persistent storage in Docker:
  - What are volumes?
  - Use `docker volume` commands to create, list, and inspect volumes.

#### **Day 12**
- Mount volumes to containers:
  - Bind mounts vs. named volumes.
  - Example: `docker run -v /host/path:/container/path`.

#### **Day 13**
- Learn Docker networking basics:
  - Bridge, Host, and None networks.
- List networks with `docker network ls`.

#### **Day 14**
- Create custom networks:
  - `docker network create mynetwork`.
  - Connect containers to networks.

#### **Day 15**
- Explore communication between containers:
  - Use `docker-compose` for defining multiple containers.

---

### **Day 16-20: Docker Compose**
#### **Day 16**
- Install Docker Compose.
- Learn what Docker Compose is and why it's used.

#### **Day 17**
- Write your first `docker-compose.yml` file:
  - Define services, networks, and volumes.

#### **Day 18**
- Start, stop, and manage multi-container applications:
  - `docker-compose up` and `docker-compose down`.

#### **Day 19**
- Explore advanced Compose configurations:
  - Environment variables.
  - Dependencies between services.

#### **Day 20**
- Use Compose for real-world projects:
  - Example: A web application with a frontend, backend, and database.

---

### **Day 21-25: Advanced Docker Concepts**
#### **Day 21**
- Learn about container logs and debugging:
  - `docker logs`, `docker exec -it <container> bash`.

#### **Day 22**
- Understand Dockerfile best practices:
  - Avoid large base images, clean up temporary files, use `.dockerignore`.

#### **Day 23**
- Work with Docker Swarm (basic orchestration):
  - Create a Swarm cluster and deploy a stack.

#### **Day 24**
- Learn about multi-stage builds for CI/CD:
  - Write a Dockerfile with multiple stages.

#### **Day 25**
- Use Docker secrets and security:
  - Secure sensitive data using Docker secrets.

---

### **Day 26-30: Projects and Real-World Use**
#### **Day 26**
- Deploy a sample application (e.g., Node.js or Python Flask) using Docker.

#### **Day 27**
- Set up a development environment with Docker Compose:
  - Example: Code-server or VSCode in Docker.

#### **Day 28**
- Push your project to GitHub with Docker configuration files.

#### **Day 29**
- Learn about Docker in cloud environments:
  - Docker on AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

#### **Day 30**
- Contribute to open-source Docker projects or start your own.
